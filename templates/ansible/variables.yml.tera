# Centralized Ansible Variables
# This file contains all dynamic variables used across Ansible playbooks.
# It follows the same pattern as OpenTofu's variables.tfvars.tera for consistency.
#
# NOTE: The inventory file (inventory.yml.tera) cannot use this file because
# Ansible inventories don't support vars_files. Only playbooks can use vars_files.

# System Configuration
ssh_port: {{ ssh_port }}
# Future service variables can be added here when needed
