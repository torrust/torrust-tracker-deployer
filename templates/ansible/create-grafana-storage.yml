# Create Grafana Storage Directory
#
# This playbook creates the Grafana data directory with correct ownership.
# Grafana container runs as user 472:472 (grafana), so the host directory
# must be owned by that user/group for the container to write data.
#
# This is required because we use bind mounts instead of named volumes.
# Docker named volumes automatically handle ownership, but bind mounts
# require explicit directory creation with correct permissions.
#
# Variables:
# - deploy_dir: Base deployment directory (e.g., /opt/torrust)
# - grafana_enabled: Whether Grafana is enabled (from variables.yml)
#
# See ADR: docs/decisions/bind-mount-standardization.md
