# Ansible Inventory File (YAML format)
# This file defines the hosts (servers/VMs/containers) that Ansible will manage
# and how to connect to them
#
# 🔗 DUAL INFRASTRUCTURE SUPPORT:
# This template supports two different infrastructure types:
#
# A) LXD VIRTUAL MACHINES (Testing & Production/OpenTofu workflow)
# B) DOCKER CONTAINERS (E2E testing/testcontainers workflow)
#
# 🔗 COMPLETE OPENTOFU + LXD VM WORKFLOW:
#
# 1. OpenTofu Provisioning (config/tofu/lxd/main.tf):
#    - Creates LXD VM named "torrust-tracker-vm" (variable: container_name)
#    - Applies cloud-init configuration from cloud-init.yml
#    - Assigns dynamic IP address via lxdbr0 network
#
# 2. Cloud-init Setup (config/tofu/lxd/cloud-init.yml):
#    - Creates user "torrust" with sudo privileges
#    - Installs SSH public key for authentication
#    - Enables SSH service for remote access
#
# 3. Ansible Connection (this file):
#    - Uses dynamic IP from step 1 (ansible_host)
#    - Connects as user from step 2 (ansible_user)
#    - Authenticates with private key matching step 2 (ansible_ssh_private_key_file)
#    - Uses standard SSH port 22 (ansible_port)
#
# 🔗 COMPLETE TESTCONTAINERS + DOCKER WORKFLOW:
#
# 1. Testcontainers Provisioning (src/e2e/containers/provisioned.rs):
#    - Creates Docker container with SSH server
#    - Maps random host port to container port 22 for SSH access
#    - Assigns container IP via Docker bridge network
#
# 2. Container Setup (docker/provisioned-instance/):
#    - Pre-configured container image with SSH server
#    - User "torrust" with sudo privileges already configured
#    - SSH public key pre-installed for authentication
#    - Cloud-init emulated via completion marker (no actual cloud-init execution)
#
# 3. Ansible Connection (this file):
#    - Uses Docker host IP (127.0.0.1) as ansible_host
#    - Connects as pre-configured user "torrust" (ansible_user)
#    - Authenticates with matching private key (ansible_ssh_private_key_file)
#    - Uses dynamic mapped port from testcontainers (ansible_port)

# 'all' is the top-level group that contains all hosts
all:
  # 'hosts' section defines individual machines
  hosts:
    # Host name: 'torrust-tracker-vm' (this is how we refer to this host in playbooks)
    # 🔗 LXD VM: This name matches var.instance_name in config/tofu/lxd/main.tf
    # 🔗 CONTAINER: This name is used consistently across both LXD VMs and Docker containers
    torrust-tracker-vm:
      # The actual IP address or hostname to connect to
      # ⚠️  IMPORTANT: This IP varies by infrastructure type
      # 🔗 LXD VM: IP assigned by lxd_instance.torrust_vm via lxdbr0 network
      # 🔗 CONTAINER: Docker host IP (127.0.0.1) for testcontainers
      # 🔗 DISCOVERY (LXD): Find current IP with: lxc list torrust-vm
      # 🔗 AUTOMATION (LXD): lxc list torrust-vm -f json | jq -r '.[0].state.network.eth0.addresses[0].address'
      ansible_host: {{ansible_host}}

      # SSH port to connect to (varies by infrastructure type)
      # 🔗 LXD VM: Standard SSH port 22
      # 🔗 CONTAINER: Dynamic mapped port from testcontainers (e.g., 32768, 32769, etc.)
      # 🔗 TESTCONTAINERS: Retrieved via container.get_host_port_ipv4(22)
      ansible_port: {{ansible_port}}

      # The username to use when connecting via SSH
      # 🔗 LXD VM: This must match the user created in cloud-init
      # 🔗 CONTAINER: This must match the pre-configured user in the container image
      # 🔗 CONFIGURED: Set via ssh_credentials.username in environment config
      ansible_user: {{ansible_user}}

      # Connection method - we're using SSH
      ansible_connection: ssh

      # Path to the private SSH key file
      # 🔗 LXD VM: This private key corresponds to the PUBLIC key in cloud-init
      # 🔗 CONTAINER: This private key corresponds to the PUBLIC key in container image
      # 🔗 EXACT MATCH (LXD): config/tofu/lxd/cloud-init.yml -> users[0].ssh_authorized_keys[0]
      # 🔗 EXACT MATCH (CONTAINER): docker/provisioned-instance/ -> pre-installed public key
      # 🔗 KEY PAIR: ~/.ssh/testing_rsa (private) <-> public key in infrastructure
      ansible_ssh_private_key_file: {{ansible_ssh_private_key_file}}

      # Additional SSH arguments for this host
      # StrictHostKeyChecking=no skips host key verification (lab/testing use only)
      # ⚠️  SECURITY: Only use this setting in development/testing environments
      # 🔗 PURPOSE: Avoids SSH fingerprint prompts for dynamic infrastructure
      ansible_ssh_common_args: "-o StrictHostKeyChecking=no"

  # 'vars' section defines variables that apply to all hosts in this group
  vars:
    # Tell Ansible which Python interpreter to use on the remote hosts
    # Most modern Linux systems use python3
    # 🔗 COMPATIBILITY: Works for both LXD VMs and Docker containers
    ansible_python_interpreter: /usr/bin/python3
