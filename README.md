# Torrust Testing Infrastructure PoC

This repository contains OpenTofu configuration for provisioning virtual machines using Multipass for Torrust testing infrastructure.

## Prerequisites

Before you can provision VMs, ensure you have the following installed:

### Check if Already Installed

First, check if the required tools are already installed on your system:

```bash
# Check if Multipass is installed
multipass version

# Check if OpenTofu is installed
tofu version
```

If both commands return version information, you can skip the installation steps below and go directly to [Provisioning](#provisioning).

### Installation

1. **Multipass**: Install from [https://multipass.run/](https://multipass.run/)

   ```bash
   # On Ubuntu/Debian
   sudo snap install multipass

   # On macOS
   brew install multipass

   # On Windows
   # Download and install from the official website
   ```

2. **OpenTofu**: Install from [https://opentofu.org/](https://opentofu.org/)

   ```bash
   # Using package manager (example for Ubuntu/Debian)
   curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -fsSL https://get.opentofu.org/install-opentofu.sh -o install-opentofu.sh
   chmod +x install-opentofu.sh
   ./install-opentofu.sh --install-method deb
   ```

## Configuration Options

This project provides two different approaches for VM provisioning and testing:

### 🖥️ **Local Development (`config/local/`)**

- **Technology**: Multipass + QEMU system mode
- **Virtualization**: Full VMs with nested virtualization
- **Best for**: Local development and testing
- **Requirements**: Supports nested virtualization (KVM/Hyper-V)
- **Cloud-init**: Full support with complete boot process

### ☁️ **CI/CD Environment (`config/ci/`)**

- **Technology**: LXD system containers
- **Virtualization**: Container-based with systemd support
- **Best for**: GitHub Actions and CI environments
- **Requirements**: No nested virtualization needed
- **Cloud-init**: Full support in container boot process

### 🔄 **Comparison**

| Feature                    | Local (Multipass)              | CI (LXD Containers)         |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------ | --------------------------- |
| **Nested Virtualization**  | ✅ Required                    | ❌ Not needed               |
| **GitHub Actions Support** | 🔶 Discovered but undocumented | ✅ Guaranteed               |
| **Cloud-init Support**     | ✅ Full VM boot                | ✅ Container boot           |
| **Resource Usage**         | ❌ Higher (full VMs)           | ✅ Lower (containers)       |
| **Isolation Level**        | ✅ Complete (separate kernel)  | 🔶 Process-level            |
| **Boot Time**              | ❌ Slower (full boot)          | ✅ Faster (container start) |
| **Systemd Services**       | ✅ Full support                | ✅ Full support             |
| **Network Isolation**      | ✅ Full isolation              | ✅ Container networking     |

## Configuration

The main configuration consists of:

- **`config/local/main.tf`** - OpenTofu configuration defining the Multipass VM
- **`config/local/cloud-init.yml`** - Cloud-init configuration for VM initialization

The setup includes:

- A Multipass virtual machine with Ubuntu 24.04 LTS (Noble Numbat)
- 2 CPUs, 2GB RAM, and 10GB disk
- Basic cloud-init setup with essential packages
- SSH configuration for remote access

### Customization

Before provisioning, you may want to customize:

1. **SSH Key**: Edit the `config/local/cloud-init.yml` file and replace the SSH key with your actual public key
2. **VM Specifications**: Adjust CPU, memory, and disk size in `config/local/main.tf`
3. **VM Name**: Change the instance name from "torrust-vm" to your preferred name
4. **Packages**: Modify the packages list in `config/local/cloud-init.yml` to include additional software

## Provisioning

To provision the virtual machine:

1. **Navigate to the OpenTofu template directory**:

   ```bash
   cd config/local
   ```

2. **Initialize OpenTofu**:

   ```bash
   tofu init
   ```

3. **Plan the deployment** (optional, to see what will be created):

   ```bash
   tofu plan
   ```

4. **Apply the configuration**:

   ```bash
   tofu apply
   ```

   Type `yes` when prompted to confirm the creation.

5. **Get VM information**:

   ```bash
   tofu output
   ```

6. **Access the VM**:

   ```bash
   # Direct shell access
   multipass shell torrust-vm

   # SSH access (if you configured your SSH key)
   ssh torrust@<vm-ip-address>
   ```

## Managing the VM

### Access the VM

```bash
# Using multipass directly
multipass shell torrust-vm

# Or via SSH (if you configured your SSH key)
ssh torrust@<vm-ip-address>
```

### Check VM status

```bash
multipass list
```

### Stop the VM

```bash
multipass stop torrust-vm
```

### Start the VM

```bash
multipass start torrust-vm
```

### Execute commands remotely

```bash
# Check if cloud-init provisioning completed
multipass exec torrust-vm -- cat /tmp/provision_complete

# Check system information
multipass exec torrust-vm -- lsb_release -a

# Install packages manually (if needed during development)
multipass exec torrust-vm -- sudo apt update
multipass exec torrust-vm -- sudo apt install -y git curl wget htop vim

# Check available disk space
multipass exec torrust-vm -- df -h

# Check running processes
multipass exec torrust-vm -- ps aux
```

## Cleanup

To destroy the virtual machine and clean up resources:

1. **Navigate to the OpenTofu template directory** (if not already there):

   ```bash
   cd config/local
   ```

2. **Destroy the infrastructure**:

   ```bash
   tofu destroy
   ```

   Type `yes` when prompted to confirm the destruction.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Multipass not found**: Ensure Multipass is installed and in your PATH
2. **Permission errors**: Make sure your user has permissions to use Multipass
3. **Network issues**: Check if your firewall allows Multipass networking

### Useful Commands

```bash
# Check Multipass version
multipass version

# List all instances
multipass list

# Get instance info
multipass info torrust-vm

# View instance logs
multipass logs torrust-vm
```

## GitHub Actions Integration

🎉 **Exciting Discovery**: This project successfully demonstrates **nested virtualization in GitHub Actions**!

Contrary to popular belief, we've proven that GitHub Actions runners can create and manage VMs using Multipass. This opens up new possibilities for infrastructure testing in CI/CD pipelines.

### Working GitHub Actions Workflow

The repository includes a fully functional GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/test-vm-provision.yml`) that:

- ✅ Installs and configures Multipass in GitHub Actions
- ✅ Provisions VMs using OpenTofu + Multipass
- ✅ Tests VM functionality (SSH, package installation, etc.)
- ✅ Automatically cleans up resources

**View successful runs**: [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/josecelano/torrust-testing-infra-poc/actions)

### Community Impact

This capability has significant implications for:

- **Infrastructure testing**: Testing VM provisioning tools in CI
- **DevOps education**: Training scenarios requiring VM creation
- **Container alternatives**: When containers aren't sufficient for testing needs

### Official Documentation Request

Since this capability isn't documented in official GitHub Actions documentation, we've created an issue to request clarification from the GitHub Actions team:

**📋 GitHub Issue**: [Documentation Request: Nested Virtualization Support in GitHub-hosted Runners](https://github.com/actions/runner-images/issues/12933)

This issue asks for official confirmation and documentation of nested virtualization capabilities in GitHub Actions runners.

## Next Steps

This is a basic setup. Future enhancements could include:

- Multiple VMs for different testing scenarios
- Custom images with pre-installed Torrust components
- Network configuration for multi-VM setups
- Enhanced CI/CD integration with nested virtualization
- Automated testing scripts
