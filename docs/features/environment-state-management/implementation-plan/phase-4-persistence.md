# Phase 4: Persistence - Implementation Plan

> **📋 Detailed Plan**  
> Breaking down Phase 4 into manageable, testable subtasks for state persistence with atomic writes and file locking.

## 🎯 Phase 4 Overview

**Goal**: Implement repository pattern for persistent state storage with atomic writes and file locking to prevent concurrent access issues.

**Why We Need This**: Enable environments to persist across command executions, survive crashes, and provide observability into deployment state without relying on memory-only storage.

**Approach**:

- Repository pattern with trait abstraction for multiple storage backends
- JSON file-based implementation as the primary storage backend
- Atomic write operations (temp file + rename) for data integrity
- File locking mechanism with process ID tracking to prevent race conditions
- Graceful handling of stale locks from crashed processes

## 📋 Implementation Subtasks

### Subtask 1: Define Repository Trait & Error Types ✅

**Purpose**: Define the contract for environment persistence operations with generic error handling that doesn't expose implementation details.

**Design Decision**: Renamed from `StateRepository` to `EnvironmentRepository` since we persist the entire `Environment<S>` (including name, credentials, instance name, state), not just the state marker. The error handling uses a generic pattern (NotFound, Conflict, Internal) to avoid exposing implementation-specific details (file paths, locks, etc.) in the trait interface.

**Changes**:

- Create new file `src/domain/environment/repository.rs`
- Define `EnvironmentRepository` trait with save/load operations
- Create `RepositoryError` enum with generic error variants
- Use `Internal(anyhow::Error)` to wrap implementation-specific errors
- Add module to `src/domain/environment/mod.rs`
- Document trait methods and error cases with examples

**Implementation Details**:

```rust
use crate::domain::environment::name::EnvironmentName;
use crate::domain::environment::state::AnyEnvironmentState;
use thiserror::Error;

/// Repository trait for persisting environments
///
/// This trait defines the contract for environment persistence operations.
/// Implementations can use different storage backends (files, databases, in-memory, etc.)
/// while maintaining consistent error handling and operation semantics.
///
/// # Concurrency
///
/// Implementations must handle concurrent access safely. File-based implementations
/// typically use locking mechanisms, while in-memory implementations might use
/// interior mutability patterns.
///
/// # Atomicity
///
/// Save operations should be atomic - either the entire environment is saved
/// successfully, or no changes are made to the storage.
///
/// # Error Handling
///
/// The trait uses `RepositoryError` as a generic error type. Implementation-specific
/// errors are wrapped in `RepositoryError::Internal(anyhow::Error)`, allowing
/// callers to handle errors generically while still supporting downcasting for
/// advanced debugging scenarios.
pub trait EnvironmentRepository {
    /// Save environment
    ///
    /// Persists the complete environment to storage. This operation should be atomic -
    /// either the entire environment is saved successfully, or no changes are made.
    ///
    /// # Errors
    ///
    /// Returns `RepositoryError::Conflict` if another process is currently modifying
    /// the same environment.
    ///
    /// Returns `RepositoryError::Internal` for implementation-specific errors such as:
    /// - Serialization failures
    /// - Storage access issues (permissions, disk full, network errors)
    /// - Lock acquisition timeouts
    fn save(&self, env: &AnyEnvironmentState) -> Result<(), RepositoryError>;

    /// Load environment by name
    ///
    /// Retrieves the environment from storage. Returns `None` if the environment
    /// has never been saved.
    ///
    /// # Errors
    ///
    /// Returns `RepositoryError::NotFound` if the environment does not exist.
    ///
    /// Returns `RepositoryError::Internal` for implementation-specific errors such as:
    /// - Deserialization failures (corrupted data)
    /// - Storage access issues
    /// - Lock acquisition timeouts
    fn load(&self, name: &EnvironmentName) -> Result<Option<AnyEnvironmentState>, RepositoryError>;

    /// Check if environment exists
    ///
    /// Returns `true` if an environment with the given name exists in storage.
    /// Does not validate that the stored data is readable or well-formed.
    ///
    /// # Errors
    ///
    /// Returns `RepositoryError::Internal` if there are storage access issues.
    fn exists(&self, name: &EnvironmentName) -> Result<bool, RepositoryError>;

    /// Delete environment
    ///
    /// Removes the persisted environment from storage. This is typically used
    /// when cleaning up after environment destruction.
    ///
    /// This operation is idempotent - deleting a non-existent environment is not an error.
    ///
    /// # Errors
    ///
    /// Returns `RepositoryError::Conflict` if another process is currently accessing
    /// the environment.
    ///
    /// Returns `RepositoryError::Internal` for implementation-specific errors such as:
    /// - Storage access issues
    /// - Lock acquisition timeouts
    fn delete(&self, name: &EnvironmentName) -> Result<(), RepositoryError>;
}

/// Errors that can occur during repository operations
///
/// This enum provides a generic error interface that doesn't expose implementation
/// details. Concrete repository implementations wrap their specific errors in
/// `Internal(anyhow::Error)`, allowing callers to:
/// - Handle errors generically in most cases
/// - Downcast to specific error types for advanced debugging
#[derive(Debug, Error)]
pub enum RepositoryError {
    /// Environment not found in storage
    ///
    /// This typically means the environment has never been saved, or has been deleted.
    #[error("Environment not found")]
    NotFound,

    /// Conflict with concurrent operation
    ///
    /// Another process is currently accessing the same environment. This can occur when:
    /// - File-based repository: Another process holds the lock
    /// - Database repository: Transaction conflict or row lock
    /// - In-memory repository: Concurrent modification detected
    #[error("Conflict: another process is accessing this environment")]
    Conflict,

    /// Internal implementation-specific error
    ///
    /// This wraps errors specific to the repository implementation:
    /// - File repository: I/O errors, serialization failures, permission issues
    /// - Database repository: Connection errors, query failures
    /// - In-memory repository: Usually not used (in-memory ops rarely fail)
    ///
    /// Advanced callers can downcast the inner `anyhow::Error` to recover the
    /// original error type for detailed debugging.
    #[error("Internal error: {0}")]
    Internal(#[from] anyhow::Error),
}
```

**Tests to Add**:

- Test that trait compiles and can be implemented
- Test error types derive Debug, Display correctly
- Test NotFound and Conflict variants display correct messages
- Test Internal variant wraps anyhow::Error correctly
- Test error conversion from anyhow::Error
- Test downcasting from Internal variant to specific error types
- Test error messages don't expose implementation details

**Success Criteria**:

- ✅ `EnvironmentRepository` trait compiles
- ✅ All trait methods documented with generic error descriptions
- ✅ `RepositoryError` enum uses generic pattern (NotFound, Conflict, Internal)
- ✅ Error messages are clear, actionable, and don't expose implementation details
- ✅ Downcasting works for debugging scenarios
- ✅ All linters pass
- ✅ All tests pass (615 tests)

**Commit**: `feat: [#24] add EnvironmentRepository trait with generic error handling`

**Status**: ✅ Complete

### Subtask 2: Implement File Locking Mechanism ✅

**Purpose**: Implement robust file locking with process ID tracking to prevent concurrent access and handle stale locks from crashed processes.

**Changes**:

- Create new file `src/infrastructure/repository/file_lock.rs`
- Implement `FileLock` struct with process ID tracking
- Add lock acquisition with timeout
- Add stale lock detection and cleanup
- Add lock release with automatic cleanup
- Comprehensive tests for all locking scenarios

**Implementation Details**:

````rust
use std::fs;
use std::path::{Path, PathBuf};
use std::process;
use std::time::{Duration, Instant};
use thiserror::Error;

/// File locking mechanism with process ID tracking
///
/// Provides exclusive access to state files by creating lock files that contain
/// the process ID of the lock holder. This prevents race conditions when multiple
/// processes attempt to read/write the same state file.
///
/// # Lock Files
///
/// Lock files are named `{state_file}.lock` and contain the process ID as text.
/// Example: `./data/my-env/state.json.lock` contains "12345"
///
/// # Stale Lock Detection
///
/// If a process crashes while holding a lock, the lock file remains but the
/// process is dead. This implementation detects stale locks by checking if
/// the process ID in the lock file is still running.
///
/// # Usage
///
/// ```rust
/// use std::path::Path;
///
/// let state_file = Path::new("./data/test-env/state.json");
/// let lock = FileLock::acquire(state_file, Duration::from_secs(5))?;
///
/// // Perform file operations...

### Subtask 3: Implement JSON File Repository ✅

**Purpose**: Implement the `EnvironmentRepository` trait using JSON files with atomic writes and file locking. Implementation-specific errors (file paths, locks, I/O) will be wrapped in `RepositoryError::Internal(anyhow::Error)`.

**Architecture Refactoring** (Implemented October 2, 2025):

During implementation, the architecture was refactored multiple times to improve reusability, separation of concerns, and organizational clarity:

1. **Generic JsonFileRepository**: Created a generic, reusable repository (`src/infrastructure/persistence/repository/json_file_repository.rs`) that can persist any serializable entity. This handles:

   - Generic file I/O operations (`save`, `load`, `exists`, `delete`)
   - Atomic writes (temp file + rename pattern)
   - File locking integration
   - Generic `JsonFileError` type (NotFound, Conflict, Internal)

2. **FileEnvironmentRepository**: Created a domain-specific implementation (`src/infrastructure/persistence/repository/file_environment_repository.rs`) that:

   - Implements the `EnvironmentRepository` trait
   - Delegates to `JsonFileRepository` for file operations
   - Maps `JsonFileError` to `RepositoryError`
   - Handles environment-specific directory structure (`./data/{env_name}/state.json`)

3. **Persistence Module Reorganization**: Evolved code structure through multiple iterations:

   - **First**: Moved `src/infrastructure/repository/` to `src/infrastructure/persistence/repository/`
   - **Second**: Further organized into `src/infrastructure/persistence/filesystem/` to better reflect the storage backend type
   - Created `src/infrastructure/persistence/mod.rs` to export the `filesystem` module
   - Created `src/infrastructure/persistence/filesystem/mod.rs` to export file-based components
   - Updated all imports to reflect new module paths: `infrastructure::persistence::filesystem`

4. **Parameterized Testing**: Enhanced test quality using `rstest` crate:

   - Replaced loop-based tests with parameterized tests
   - Each test case runs independently with clear identification
   - Better test output showing individual case results
   - Example: Multi-environment path structure verification test

5. **Documentation Updates**:
   - Updated `docs/contributing/testing.md` with parameterized testing best practices
   - Documented when to use parameterized tests vs loops
   - Added setup instructions for `rstest` crate

**Benefits of This Refactoring**:

- **Reusability**: `JsonFileRepository` can be used for persisting other domain entities (configurations, metadata, etc.)
- **Separation of Concerns**: File I/O logic separated from domain-specific logic
- **Clearer Architecture**: `filesystem` module name better describes the storage backend type
- **Future Extensibility**: Easy to add other persistence backends (e.g., `database`, `memory`, `cloud`)
- **Cleaner Code**: `FileEnvironmentRepository` focuses on environment-specific concerns (paths, error mapping)
- **Testability**: Both layers can be tested independently with comprehensive test coverage
- **Better Test Quality**: Parameterized tests provide better isolation and clearer failure identification

**Changes**:

- ✅ Created `src/infrastructure/persistence/filesystem/json_file_repository.rs` (generic, 608 lines)
- ✅ Created `src/infrastructure/persistence/filesystem/file_environment_repository.rs` (domain-specific, 563 lines)
- ✅ Created `src/infrastructure/persistence/filesystem/mod.rs` to export components
- ✅ Created `src/infrastructure/persistence/mod.rs` to export filesystem module
- ✅ Implemented `JsonFileRepository` as generic collaborator for any serializable type
- ✅ Implemented `FileEnvironmentRepository` implementing `EnvironmentRepository` trait
- ✅ Used atomic write pattern (write to temp file, then rename)
- ✅ Integrated `FileLock` for all operations
- ✅ Converted implementation-specific errors appropriately
- ✅ Added `rstest` dev-dependency for parameterized testing
- ✅ Added comprehensive tests for both layers (31 new tests total)
  - 14 tests for `JsonFileRepository`
  - 17 tests for `FileEnvironmentRepository` (including 4 parameterized test cases)
- ✅ Updated documentation with parameterized testing best practices

## 📊 Actual Test Coverage After Phase 4 ✅

- **Subtask 1**: +5 tests (trait, error types) - Tests integrated into repository implementation
- **Subtask 2**: +12 tests (file locking, concurrency, stale lock detection)
- **Subtask 3**: +31 tests (repository operations, integration, parameterized tests)
  - JsonFileRepository: 14 tests
  - FileEnvironmentRepository: 17 tests (including 4 parameterized test cases)
- **Total New Tests**: 31 tests (efficient integration reduced duplication)
- **Total Project Tests**: 663 tests (up from 632 after Phase 3)
- **Test Growth**: +31 tests (+4.9% increase)

## 🔄 Integration with Previous Phases

Phase 4 builds on all previous phases:

- Uses `AnyEnvironmentState` from Phase 3 for type erasure
- Serializes/deserializes using Serde derives from Phase 3
- Benefits from Phase 2 logging (can log state persistence events)
- Operates on generic `Environment<S>` from Phase 1
- Maintains all type-safe transitions from Phase 1

## 🚀 What Comes After Phase 4

Once Phase 4 is complete, Phase 5 will integrate persistence into commands:

- Commands will save state after each transition
- Commands will load state before execution to verify preconditions
- Error states will be persisted for user visibility
- Status command will read persisted state
- Environment cleanup will delete persisted state

## 🔍 Design Decisions & Rationale

### Why Repository Pattern?

**Chosen**: Trait-based repository abstraction  
**Alternative**: Concrete implementation only

**Rationale**:

1. ✅ **Flexibility**: Easy to add database backend later
2. ✅ **Testing**: Can create in-memory implementation for tests
3. ✅ **Separation**: Domain logic separated from storage details
4. ✅ **Future-Proof**: Easy to add caching, remote storage, etc.

### Why EnvironmentRepository (Not StateRepository)?

**Chosen**: `EnvironmentRepository` trait name  
**Alternative**: `StateRepository` trait name

**Rationale**:

1. ✅ **Accuracy**: We persist the entire `Environment<S>` object, not just the state
2. ✅ **Clarity**: The name reflects what is actually stored in the repository
3. ✅ **Domain Alignment**: Matches domain terminology - environments have states, not states have environments
4. ✅ **API Intent**: Methods like `save(environment)` and `load() -> Environment` make the purpose clear

### Why Generic Error Types (Not Implementation-Specific)?

**Chosen**: Generic `RepositoryError` with `NotFound`, `Conflict`, `Internal(anyhow::Error)` variants  
**Alternative**: File-system-specific errors (e.g., `FileLocked { path, pid }`, `WriteError { path }`)

**Rationale**:

1. ✅ **Abstraction**: Trait interface doesn't expose storage implementation details
2. ✅ **Flexibility**: Works equally well for file, database, or in-memory implementations
3. ✅ **Simplicity**: Callers handle 3 generic cases, not N file-specific cases
4. ✅ **Future-Proof**: Can add new implementations without changing error API
5. ✅ **Debugging**: Advanced users can still downcast `Internal` variant to access original errors
6. ✅ **Error Handling Guide**: Aligns with project principle: "errors should be actionable without exposing implementation details"

**Example - Why this matters**:

```rust
// ❌ BAD: Exposes file-system implementation details in trait
pub enum RepositoryError {
    FileLocked { path: PathBuf, pid: u32 },  // Only makes sense for file storage
    WriteError { path: PathBuf, error: std::io::Error },  // File-specific
}

// ✅ GOOD: Generic errors work for any storage backend
pub enum RepositoryError {
    NotFound,  // Works for files, databases, memory, etc.
    Conflict,  // Generic: concurrent access detected
    Internal(#[from] anyhow::Error),  // Wraps implementation-specific details
}

// Implementation can wrap specific errors:
// File implementation: io::Error, lock acquisition → Internal
// Database implementation: sqlx::Error → Internal
// In-memory implementation: May not even need Internal variant
```

### Why Atomic Writes (Temp File + Rename)?

**Chosen**: Write to temp file, fsync, then rename  
**Alternative**: Direct file write

**Rationale**:

1. ✅ **Atomicity**: Rename is atomic on Unix and Windows
2. ✅ **Crash Safety**: Never see partial state
3. ✅ **Consistency**: State file is always valid or absent
4. ✅ **Industry Standard**: Used by databases, editors, etc.

### Why File Locking with Process IDs?

**Chosen**: Lock files with PID, stale lock detection  
**Alternative**: OS-level file locks (flock/LockFile)

**Rationale**:

1. ✅ **Portability**: Works on Unix and Windows
2. ✅ **Debugging**: Can see which process holds lock
3. ✅ **Crash Recovery**: Can detect and clean stale locks
4. ✅ **Simplicity**: No need for OS-specific locking APIs
5. ⚠️ **Trade-off**: Slightly more complex than OS locks

### Why 10-Second Default Lock Timeout?

**Chosen**: 10 seconds  
**Alternative**: Shorter (1s) or longer (30s)

**Rationale**:

1. ✅ **Balance**: Long enough for normal operations
2. ✅ **Responsive**: Short enough for good UX on errors
3. ✅ **Typical Operations**: State save/load completes in <100ms
4. ✅ **Network Filesystems**: Allows for slightly slower I/O

## 🛡️ Error Handling Strategy

All errors in Phase 4 follow the project's error handling principles:

### Clarity

- Error messages clearly state what went wrong
- Include file paths, process IDs, and other context
- Distinguish between expected failures and bugs

### Traceability

- All errors preserve source error chains with `#[source]`
- Log error context at appropriate tracing levels
- Include enough information to diagnose issues from logs

### Actionability

- Error messages suggest how to fix the problem
- Lock errors show which process holds the lock
- Permission errors point to permission issues
- Corruption errors suggest file deletion/recreation

### Examples

```rust
// ✅ Good: Clear, traceable, actionable
RepositoryError::LockAcquisitionFailed {
    path: "./data/my-env/state.json",
    holder_pid: Some(12345),
}
// Message: "Failed to acquire lock for state file: ./data/my-env/state.json, held by process 12345"
// Action: User can check process 12345, wait, or kill it if stale

// ✅ Good: Includes source for traceability
RepositoryError::WriteStateFailed {
    path: "./data/my-env/state.json",
    source: io::Error(PermissionDenied),
}
// Message: "Failed to write state file: ./data/my-env/state.json"
// Source: "Permission denied"
// Action: User can check directory permissions
```

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests

- Test each component in isolation
- Mock file system operations where appropriate
- Test error paths and edge cases
- Verify error messages and source chains

### Integration Tests

- Test full save/load cycle with real files
- Test concurrent access scenarios with threads
- Test stale lock detection with simulated crashes
- Test atomic write behavior
- Use temporary directories for isolation

### Property Tests (Optional)

- Round-trip property: `load(save(x)) == Some(x)`
- Idempotence property: `delete(delete(x)) == delete(x)`
- Atomicity property: Concurrent operations never corrupt data

### Concurrency Tests

- Multiple threads attempting simultaneous saves
- Multiple threads reading while one writes
- Lock timeout behavior under contention
- Stale lock cleanup during concurrent access

## 📝 Implementation Notes

### File System Operations

All file system operations must be wrapped in proper error handling:

```rust
// ✅ Good
fs::create_dir_all(&dir_path).map_err(|source| {
    RepositoryError::DirectoryCreationFailed {
        path: dir_path,
        source,
    }
})?;

// ❌ Bad - loses error context
fs::create_dir_all(&dir_path)?;
```

### Lock Ordering

To prevent deadlocks, always acquire locks in consistent order:

1. Environment directory lock (if needed)
2. State file lock
3. Lock file operations

### Resource Cleanup

Use RAII pattern for automatic cleanup:

- `FileLock` drops automatically release locks
- Use `tempfile` crate if need managed temp files
- Ensure locks released even on errors (Drop impl)

## 🔒 Security Considerations

### File Permissions

- State files should be readable only by owner
- Lock files should be readable/writable only by owner
- Consider setting umask appropriately

### Process ID Spoofing

- Process ID in lock file is for debugging, not security
- Don't rely on PIDs for authentication
- Lock files provide coordination, not protection

### State File Contents

- State files may contain sensitive information (SSH keys)
- Consider encryption for production use (future enhancement)
- Document security expectations in user guide

## ⚡ Performance Considerations

### I/O Optimization

- Fsync only on writes, not reads
- Consider buffering for batch operations (future)
- Lock acquisition timeout should be configurable

### Lock Contention

- Short critical sections minimize contention
- Read operations take locks (consistent reads)
- Consider read-write locks if read-heavy (future)

### File System Load

- Atomic writes create temporary files
- Lock files create additional I/O
- Acceptable for deployment tool usage patterns
