# PR Review Guide

This guide helps reviewers verify that pull requests meet our quality standards. Use this as a systematic checklist when reviewing code to ensure consistency and catch issues early.

> **Note**: This is a living document that will evolve as we learn from reviews. All automated checks (linters, tests, builds) must pass before review begins.

## 📋 Quality Standards Checklist

### Branching & Commits

Verify contributors followed these project conventions:

- [ ] **Branch name** follows `{issue-number}-{description}` format (see [branching.md](./branching.md))
- [ ] **Commit messages** use conventional format:
  - With issue branch: `{type}: [#{issue}] {description}`
  - Without issue branch: `{type}: {description}`
  - See [commit-process.md](./commit-process.md) for details
- [ ] **Pre-commit checks** passed (contributor should have run `./scripts/pre-commit.sh`)

### Code Quality

- [ ] **DDD layer placement** is correct - business logic in domain, orchestration in application, external integrations in infrastructure (see [ddd-layer-placement.md](./ddd-layer-placement.md))
- [ ] **Error handling** uses explicit enum errors with context, not generic strings (see [error-handling.md](./error-handling.md))
- [ ] **Errors are actionable** - include clear guidance on how to fix the issue
- [ ] **Module organization** follows conventions: public before private, top-down structure (see [module-organization.md](./module-organization.md))
- [ ] **Code is clean and maintainable** - clear naming, minimal complexity, well-structured
- [ ] **No obvious security vulnerabilities** introduced

### Testing

- [ ] **New logic has appropriate test coverage** (see [testing/](./testing/))
- [ ] **Tests follow naming conventions** (`it_should_...` pattern)
- [ ] **Tests are isolated** - use temporary resources, don't depend on external state
- [ ] **Tests are readable** - clear intent and easy to understand what's being tested
- [ ] **Both production and test code** meet quality standards (clean, maintainable, sustainable)

### Documentation

- [ ] **Significant architectural decisions** documented as ADRs in `docs/decisions/` (see [decisions/README.md](../decisions/README.md))
- [ ] **Public APIs have rustdoc comments** with clear descriptions
- [ ] **Complex logic is explained** with comments where necessary
- [ ] **User-facing documentation updated** if behavior changes affect users

### Templates (if applicable)

- [ ] **Tera templates use correct syntax**: `{{ variable }}` not `{ { variable } }` (see [templates.md](./templates.md))
- [ ] **Static Ansible playbooks** (without `.tera` extension) are registered in `src/infrastructure/external_tools/ansible/template/renderer/mod.rs`

## 🚩 Quick Red Flags

Watch for these common issues that indicate quality problems:

### Architecture Violations

- ❌ **File I/O in domain or application layers** - Should be in infrastructure
- ❌ **Business logic in infrastructure or presentation layers** - Should be in domain
- ❌ **Presentation layer directly calling infrastructure** - Should go through application layer
- ❌ **Domain layer depending on infrastructure** - Violates dependency flow rules
- ❌ **Mixing concerns across layers** - Each layer should have clear responsibilities

### Error Handling Issues

- ❌ **Generic string errors** instead of typed enums - Use explicit error types
- ❌ **Error messages without context** - Include what, where, when, why
- ❌ **Error messages without actionable guidance** - Tell user how to fix it
- ❌ **Lost error chains** - Missing source preservation, can't trace root cause
- ❌ **Using `anyhow` where explicit enums would be better** - Prefer pattern matching

### Code Organization Problems

- ❌ **Private items before public items** in modules - Public should come first
- ❌ **Low-level details before high-level abstractions** - Use top-down organization
- ❌ **Error types mixed with main implementation logic** - Separate concerns
- ❌ **Inconsistent naming** - Follow Rust conventions and project patterns

### Testing Issues

- ❌ **Tests using `unwrap()` without explanation** - Use proper error handling
- ❌ **Tests creating real directories** instead of temp directories - Use `TempDir`
- ❌ **Missing tests for new error paths** - Error handling should be tested
- ❌ **Tests that depend on external state** - Tests should be isolated
- ❌ **Test code that doesn't meet production quality standards** - Both should be clean

### Known Issues vs. Real Problems

Be aware of expected behaviors documented in [known-issues.md](./known-issues.md):

- ✅ **SSH host key warnings** in E2E test output are normal and expected
- ✅ **Red error messages** during setup don't always indicate failure
- ❌ **New unexpected failures** should be investigated and resolved

## 🗣️ Providing Feedback

### Be Constructive and Specific

When providing feedback:

1. **Point to documentation** - Reference specific contributing guides
2. **Be specific** - Link to exact lines and explain the concern clearly
3. **Suggest alternatives** - Provide examples or point to similar code in the codebase
4. **Explain why** - Help contributors understand the reasoning behind standards
5. **Distinguish severity** - Make clear whether something is blocking or a suggestion

### Example Feedback

**Good feedback** references our documentation and is constructive:

> This error handling doesn't follow our guidelines from [error-handling.md](./error-handling.md). Errors should use explicit enums with context rather than generic strings.
>
> Please see the example in `src/domain/config/error.rs` which shows how to create a typed error enum with proper context fields. This will make the errors more actionable for users and easier to handle in calling code.

**Better feedback** is specific and actionable:

> In `src/application/commands/provision.rs` line 42, using `.unwrap()` will panic if the file doesn't exist. Instead:
>
> 1. Define an error variant in the command's error enum for file not found
> 2. Use `.map_err()` to convert the I/O error to your domain error
> 3. Include the file path in the error context
>
> See [error-handling.md](./error-handling.md) section 2 for the pattern.

### When to Request Changes vs. Comment vs. Approve

**Request Changes** - Blocking issues that violate documented standards:

- Architectural violations (wrong DDD layer placement)
- Security vulnerabilities introduced
- Breaking existing functionality
- Missing required tests for new code
- Error handling that doesn't meet standards
- Pre-commit checks not passing

**Comment** - Suggestions or questions (non-blocking improvements):

- Minor style inconsistencies not caught by linters
- Optional refactoring opportunities
- Questions about approach or implementation
- Nice-to-have documentation improvements
- Suggestions for future enhancements

**Approve** - All standards met:

- All quality checklist items verified
- No blocking issues found
- Changes are minimal and focused
- Tests pass and provide good coverage
- Documentation is adequate
- Code follows project conventions

## 🔄 Evolving This Guide

This is a living document. As we identify new patterns during reviews, we can:

1. **Update this guide** with new checklist items or red flags
2. **Update specific contributing guides** for detailed guidance on particular topics
3. **Add to "Quick Red Flags"** section for common review issues we encounter
4. **Document new architectural decisions** as ADRs in `docs/decisions/`
5. **Update issue templates** if acceptance criteria patterns emerge

If you notice patterns that should be added to this guide, please:

- Create an issue to discuss the addition
- Reference examples from recent PRs that show the pattern
- Propose specific checklist items or red flag entries
- Update relevant contributing guides with detailed guidance
