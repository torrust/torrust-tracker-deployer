# Torrust Tracker Deployer - Roadmap

**GitHub Issue**: [#1 - Roadmap](https://github.com/torrust/torrust-tracker-deployer/issues/1)

This document outlines the development roadmap for the Torrust Tracker Deployer project. Each task is marked with:

- `[ ]` - Not completed
- `[x]` - Completed

## Development Process

When starting work on a new feature:

1. Create the feature documentation in the `docs/features/` folder and commit it
2. Open an issue on GitHub linking to the feature folder in the repository
3. Add the new issue as a child issue of the main EPIC issue

> **Note:** See [`docs/features/README.md`](./features/README.md) for detailed conventions and process guide for creating new features.

## Roadmap

### 1. Add scaffolding for main app

**Epic Issue**: [#2 - Scaffolding for main app](https://github.com/torrust/torrust-tracker-deployer/issues/2)

- [x] **1.1** Setup logging - [Issue #3](https://github.com/torrust/torrust-tracker-deployer/issues/3) ✅ Completed
  - [x] Setup logging for production CLI - [PR #4](https://github.com/torrust/torrust-tracker-deployer/pull/4)
  - [x] Remove ANSI codes from file logging - [Issue #5](https://github.com/torrust/torrust-tracker-deployer/issues/5), [PR #7](https://github.com/torrust/torrust-tracker-deployer/pull/7)
- [x] **1.2** Create command `torrust-tracker-deployer destroy` to destroy an environment ✅ Completed
  - Parent EPIC: [Implement `destroy` Command](https://github.com/torrust/torrust-tracker-deployer/issues/8) - GitHub Issue #8
  - Split into two child EPICs for incremental delivery:
    - [x] **Child EPIC #9**: [App Layer Destroy Command](https://github.com/torrust/torrust-tracker-deployer/issues/9) - Core business logic
    - [x] **Child EPIC #10**: [UI Layer Destroy Command](https://github.com/torrust/torrust-tracker-deployer/issues/10) - CLI interface
- [ ] **1.3** Refactor extract shared code between testing and production for app bootstrapping
- [ ] **1.4** Improve command to use better abstraction to handle presentation layer
  - types to handle user's views, etc
- [x] **1.5** Create command `torrust-tracker-deployer create` to create a new environment ✅ Completed
  - EPIC: [Implement Create Environment Command](https://github.com/torrust/torrust-tracker-deployer/issues/34) - GitHub Issue #34
- [ ] **1.6** Create command `torrust-tracker-deployer provision` to provision VM infrastructure (UI layer only)
  - **Note:** The App layer ProvisionCommand is already implemented, this task focuses on the console subcommand interface
  - Implementation should call the existing ProvisionCommand business logic
  - Handle user input, validation, and output presentation
- [ ] **1.7** Add levels of verbosity as described in the UX research

**Note:** See [`docs/research/UX/`](./research/UX/) for detailed UX research that will be useful to implement the features in this section.

**Future Enhancement:** The `torrust-tracker-deployer deploy` porcelain command (intelligent orchestration of plumbing commands) will be implemented after the core plumbing commands are stable. See [`docs/features/hybrid-command-architecture/`](./features/hybrid-command-architecture/) for the complete specification.

### 2. Add new infrastructure provider: Hetzner

- [ ] **2.1** Add Hetzner provider support

### 3. Continue adding more application commands

**Note:** These are internal app layer commands (like ProvisionCommand or ConfigureCommand), not console commands. The approach is to slice by functional services rather than deployment stages - we fully deploy a working stack from the beginning and incrementally add new services.

- [ ] **3.1** Finish ConfigureCommand - [Epic #16](https://github.com/torrust/torrust-tracker-deployer/issues/16)
  - Add system security configuration (automatic updates, UFW firewall)
  - Refactor Ansible templates to centralized variables pattern
- [ ] **3.2** Implement ReleaseCommand (App layer business logic)
  - Core business logic for deploying Torrust Tracker application files and configuration
  - Template generation and file deployment to provisioned infrastructure
- [ ] **3.3** Add ReleaseCommand and RunCommand with slices

  - [ ] **3.3.1** Run only a docker compose configuration with hello-world docker image
  - [ ] **3.3.2** Add MySQL to docker compose stack
  - [ ] **3.3.3** Add Torrust Tracker to docker compose stack
  - [ ] **3.3.4** Add Prometheus to docker compose stack
  - [ ] **3.3.5** Add Grafana to docker compose stack

  **Notes:**

  - Each service will require new templates, template Rust wrappers, environment options, etc.

### 4. Create a docker image for the deployer

- [ ] **4.1** Create docker image for the deployer to use it without needing to install the dependencies (OpenTofu, Ansible, etc)
  - Mount data and build dirs when running it.

### 5. Add extra console app commands

- [ ] **5.1** `torrust-tracker-deployer status` - Check environment and service status
- [ ] **5.2** `torrust-tracker-deployer test` - Run application tests

**Note:** The test console subcommand is already partially implemented.

### 6. Add HTTPS support

- [ ] **6.1** Add HTTPS support for HTTP tracker
- [ ] **6.2** Add HTTPS support for tracker API
- [ ] **6.3** Add HTTPS support for Grafana

### 7. Add backup and disaster recovery

- [ ] **7.1** Implement database backups for MySQL
- [ ] **7.2** Implement configuration backups
- [ ] **7.3** Create recovery procedures documentation

## Notes

- This roadmap will be linked to an EPIC issue on GitHub for tracking progress
- Each major feature should have corresponding documentation in `docs/features/` before implementation begins
