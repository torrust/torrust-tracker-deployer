# Ansible Playbook Testing Strategy

## Overview

This document outlines the testing strategy for Ansible playbooks in the Torrust Tracker Deployer project. Based on comprehensive research and the implementation of **E2E Test Split Architecture**, we have established a **phase-specific testing approach** that uses both LXD containers and Docker containers optimally for different deployment phases.

## Updated Strategy (September 2025)

After extensive research, testing, and architecture evolution, we have adopted a **phase-specific testing strategy** that prioritizes:

- **Phase Separation**: Different deployment phases tested with optimal technologies
- **Completeness**: Full coverage from infrastructure provisioning to application deployment
- **Efficiency**: Fast feedback loops where possible, comprehensive testing where necessary
- **Production Parity**: Test environments that accurately reflect production behavior

## Requirements by Deployment Phase

### Provision Phase Testing (LXD VMs)

- ✅ Test VM provisioning and infrastructure creation
- ✅ Validate cloud-init execution and completion
- ✅ Verify SSH access and user setup
- ✅ Confirm network connectivity and basic system state
- ✅ Test OpenTofu infrastructure management

### Configuration Phase Testing (Docker Containers)

- ✅ Test Ansible playbooks like `install-docker.yml`, `install-docker-compose.yml`
- ✅ Validate software installation and system configuration
- ✅ Support Docker-in-Docker scenarios for application deployment
- ✅ Test service management and configuration
- ✅ Verify package downloads and dependency installation

## Current Strategy: Phase-Specific Testing Approach

### Core Decision

**Use optimal technology per deployment phase** based on research findings and E2E test split architecture:

1. **Provision Phase**: **LXD VMs** for complete infrastructure testing

   - ✅ Full VM provisioning and cloud-init testing
   - ✅ Real networking and system-level capabilities
   - ✅ Production-equivalent environment behavior
   - ⏱️ ~20-30s setup time (acceptable for comprehensive testing)

2. **Configuration Phase**: **Docker Containers** for fast Ansible testing
   - ✅ Fast feedback loops (~3-5s setup time)
   - ✅ Docker-in-Docker support for application deployment
   - ✅ Sufficient system capabilities for software installation
   - ✅ Reliable GitHub Actions compatibility

### Testing Workflows

#### 1. Provision and Destroy Phase Testing (e2e-provision-and-destroy-tests)

```bash
# Test infrastructure provisioning and destruction lifecycle with LXD VMs
cargo run --bin e2e-provision-and-destroy-tests

# What this tests:
# - VM creation via OpenTofu + LXD
# - Cloud-init completion and user setup
# - SSH access and connectivity
# - Basic system state validation
# - Infrastructure destruction via DestroyCommand
# - Fallback to manual cleanup on destroy failures
# Time: ~20-30 seconds
```

#### 2. Configuration Phase Testing (e2e-config-tests)

```bash
# Test software installation with Docker containers
cargo run --bin e2e-config-tests

# What this tests:
# - Container creation (provisioned-instance state)
# - Ansible playbook execution:
#   - install-docker.yml
#   - install-docker-compose.yml
#   - update-apt-cache.yml
# - Service configuration and validation
# Time: ~10-15 seconds total
```

#### 3. Parallel Execution

Both test suites can run independently and in parallel:

```bash
# Run both test phases simultaneously
cargo run --bin e2e-provision-and-destroy-tests &
cargo run --bin e2e-config-tests &
wait
```

### Benefits of Phase-Specific Approach

- **Optimal Performance**: Fast feedback for configuration changes (~3-5s), comprehensive testing for infrastructure (~20-30s)
- **Better Isolation**: Infrastructure issues don't block configuration testing and vice versa
- **Parallel Execution**: Both phases can run simultaneously, reducing total test time
- **Technology Fit**: Each phase uses the most appropriate technology for its requirements
- **Easier Debugging**: Clear separation makes it easier to identify whether issues are infrastructure or configuration related
- **CI/CD Optimized**: Docker containers avoid GitHub Actions networking issues while LXD provides complete VM testing

## Selected Strategy

### Phase-Specific Testing Architecture

Based on comprehensive research, performance testing, and E2E test split implementation, we have adopted a **phase-specific testing strategy** that provides:

#### Core Components

1. **Provision Phase (LXD VMs)**:

   - Complete infrastructure provisioning testing
   - Cloud-init and VM lifecycle validation
   - OpenTofu infrastructure management testing
   - Production-equivalent environment behavior

2. **Configuration Phase (Docker Containers)**:

   - Fast Ansible playbook testing
   - Software installation and configuration validation
   - Docker-in-Docker capability for application deployment
   - Efficient CI/CD pipeline integration

3. **Container Architecture**: `docker/provisioned-instance/`
   - Ubuntu 24.04 LTS base (matches production VMs)
   - SSH server via supervisor (not systemd)
   - Password + SSH key authentication support
   - Ready state for configuration phase testing

#### Implementation Details

**Provision Phase Testing**:

- Ubuntu 24.04 LXD containers with cloud-init support
- OpenTofu infrastructure management
- SSH access using fixtures/testing_rsa keys
- VM creation and basic system validation

**Configuration Phase Testing**:

- `docker/provisioned-instance/` container simulation
- Ansible connectivity via SSH (password + key auth)
- Docker container lifecycle management
- Software installation and service configuration

**Test Execution Patterns**:

```bash
# Provision and destroy phase (runs independently)
cargo run --bin e2e-provision-and-destroy-tests
# - VM creation ~20-30s
# - Cloud-init validation
# - SSH connectivity verification
# - Infrastructure destruction via DestroyCommand
# - Cleanup and resource management

# Configuration phase (runs independently)
cargo run --bin e2e-config-tests
# - Container creation ~2-3s
# - SSH key setup via password auth
# - Ansible playbook execution
# - Software installation validation
# - Container cleanup
```

**Performance Metrics**:

- Provision phase: ~20-30 seconds (comprehensive infrastructure testing)
- Configuration phase: ~10-15 seconds (fast configuration validation)
- **Total parallel execution**: ~20-30 seconds (both phases simultaneously)
- **Significant improvement**: 50-60% faster than sequential LXD-only approach

#### Built-in Validation Requirements

Each playbook must include:

- **Pre-condition checks**: Verify environment requirements before execution
- **Post-condition validation**: Confirm expected state after execution
- **Idempotency testing**: Ensure safe re-execution
- **Error handling**: Graceful failure with clear messaging

## Rationale for LXD-Only Approach

## Rationale for Phase-Specific Approach

This strategy addresses our specific needs by leveraging the best aspects of both technologies while avoiding their limitations:

### Why LXD for Provision Phase

- **Complete VM Testing**: Full cloud-init, networking, and system-level capability testing
- **Production Equivalence**: LXD containers behave identically to cloud VMs
- **Infrastructure Focus**: Tests actual VM provisioning and infrastructure management
- **OpenTofu Integration**: Natural fit for infrastructure-as-code testing

### Why Docker for Configuration Phase

- **Fast Feedback**: ~3-5s setup enables rapid configuration development cycles
- **Docker-in-Docker**: Proven capability for application deployment testing (research validated)
- **CI/CD Optimized**: Avoids GitHub Actions networking issues encountered with LXD
- **Sufficient Capabilities**: Meets all requirements for software installation and configuration testing

### Combined Benefits

- **Optimal Performance**: Fast where possible, comprehensive where necessary
- **Better Test Isolation**: Infrastructure and configuration issues don't interfere with each other
- **Parallel Execution**: Significant time savings through concurrent test execution
- **Technology Appropriateness**: Each phase uses the most suitable technology
- **Easier Maintenance**: Clear separation of concerns reduces complexity
