# User Output Architecture Improvements

**Issue**: [#102](https://github.com/torrust/torrust-tracker-deployer/issues/102)
**Parent Epic**: N/A (Standalone refactoring epic)
**Roadmap**: N/A (Code quality improvement)
**Related**: [Refactoring Plan](../refactors/plans/user-output-architecture-improvements.md)

## Overview

This Epic refactors the `UserOutput` module (`src/presentation/user_output.rs`) to improve clarity, testability, maintainability, and sustainability. The current implementation mixes concerns (formatting, routing, verbosity control) and lacks extensibility for different output styles and destinations.

## Refactoring Plan

See comprehensive refactoring plan: [docs/refactors/plans/user-output-architecture-improvements.md](../refactors/plans/user-output-architecture-improvements.md)

## Goals

- [ ] **Separate Concerns**: Extract verbosity filtering, theme configuration, and formatting logic
- [ ] **Simplify Testing**: Improve test infrastructure and reduce duplication
- [ ] **Enable Extensibility**: Support different output styles (emoji, plain text, JSON) and destinations
- [ ] **Improve Maintainability**: Reduce code duplication and establish clear abstractions
- [ ] **Maintain Quality**: All refactorings must pass pre-commit checks and maintain test coverage

## Proposals Summary

### Phase 0: Quick Wins (High Impact, Low Effort)

- **Proposal #0**: Extract Verbosity Filtering Logic
- **Proposal #1**: Simplify Test Infrastructure
- **Proposal #2**: Add Theme/Configuration Support

### Phase 1: Strategic Improvements (High Impact, Medium Effort)

- **Proposal #3**: Use Message Trait for Extensibility
- **Proposal #5**: Parameterized Test Cases

### Phase 2: Polish & Extensions (Medium Impact, Low-Medium Effort)

- **Proposal #4**: Add Alternative Formatters (optional enhancement)
- **Proposal #6**: Type-Safe Channel Routing
- **Proposal #7**: Add Buffering Control
- **Proposal #8**: Builder Pattern for Complex Messages
- **Proposal #9**: Output Sink Abstraction

## Key Architectural Decision

**Trait-Based Message System**: Each message type (`ProgressMessage`, `SuccessMessage`, etc.) implements the `OutputMessage` trait with its own formatting, verbosity requirements, and channel routing. This achieves true Open/Closed Principle - new message types can be added without modifying existing code.

**Alternative Considered**: Enum-based messages with centralized formatter. Discarded because pattern matching on enum variants requires modifying the formatter for each new message type, violating the Open/Closed Principle.

## Implementation Strategy

**Incremental Approach**: Create subissues for each proposal as work progresses. This allows adapting the implementation to the current codebase state and adjusting for any discoveries made during implementation.

## Sub-Tasks

Subissues will be created incrementally before implementing each proposal:

- [ ] [#103](https://github.com/torrust/torrust-tracker-deployer/issues/103) - Proposal #0: Extract Verbosity Filtering Logic
- [ ] Future subissues to be created as work progresses

## Timeline

- **Estimated Duration**: 3-4 weeks (with parallel development possible)
- **Target Completion**: End of November 2025
