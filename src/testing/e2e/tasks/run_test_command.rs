//! Deployment validation task for E2E testing
//!
//! This module provides comprehensive deployment validation functionality for E2E
//! testing. It verifies that deployed infrastructure is working correctly by
//! running a series of validation checks through the `TestCommandHandler`.
//!
//! ## Validation Areas
//!
//! - Infrastructure service validation (Docker, Docker Compose)
//! - System initialization validation (cloud-init completion)
//! - Network connectivity and SSH access verification
//! - Application deployment readiness checks
//!
//! ## Key Features
//!
//! - Comprehensive validation via `TestCommandHandler` orchestration
//! - Async execution for efficient testing workflows
//! - Detailed logging and error reporting
//! - Integration with E2E testing pipeline
//!
//! This task ensures that the complete deployment workflow has resulted in a
//! functional environment ready for application deployment.

1. Verify provisioning completed:
   - Check environment.json for instance_ip field
   - Ensure provision command completed successfully
   - Look for OpenTofu output errors

2. If provisioning succeeded but IP is missing:
   - Check OpenTofu outputs configuration
   - Verify the instance was actually created
   - Check LXD/provider for instance status

3. Recovery steps:
   - Re-run the provision command
   - Or destroy and recreate the environment

For more information, see the E2E testing documentation."

1. Check which validation failed:
   - Cloud-init completion check
   - Docker installation check
   - Docker Compose installation check

2. Verify instance is accessible:
   - Test SSH connection manually
   - Check instance is running (not stopped or crashed)
   - Verify network connectivity

3. Check service installation:
   - SSH into instance and verify services manually
   - Check configuration playbooks completed successfully
   - Review Ansible logs for installation errors

4. Common issues:
   - Cloud-init still running (wait a few minutes)
   - Docker daemon not started
   - Services installed but not in PATH
   - Incomplete configuration phase

5. Recovery steps:
   - Wait for cloud-init to complete (check with: cloud-init status)
   - Re-run configuration command if services missing
   - Check instance system logs (journalctl)
