//! Container-specific preflight cleanup functionality
//!
//! This module provides preflight cleanup functionality specifically designed
//! for Docker container-based E2E testing. Since containers are managed by
//! testcontainers and automatically cleaned up, this module only handles
//! directory cleanup operations.

/// Performs pre-flight cleanup for Docker-based E2E tests
///
/// This function cleans up any artifacts remaining from previous test runs that may have
/// failed to clean up properly. It's designed for Docker-based E2E tests that use
/// testcontainers for container lifecycle management. It cleans up directories
/// and any hanging Docker containers from previous interrupted test runs.
///
/// # Arguments
///
/// * `env` - The test environment containing configuration and services
///
/// # Returns
///
/// Returns `Ok(())` if cleanup succeeds or if there were no resources to clean up.
///
/// # Errors
///
/// Returns an error if directory cleanup fails and would prevent new test runs.
