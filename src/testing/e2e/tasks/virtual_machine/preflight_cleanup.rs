//! Virtual machine-specific preflight cleanup functionality
//!
//! This module provides preflight cleanup functionality specifically designed
//! for VM-based E2E testing using LXD and `OpenTofu`. It handles cleanup of
//! infrastructure resources including `OpenTofu` state and LXD instances.

/// Performs comprehensive pre-flight cleanup for VM-based E2E tests
///
/// This function cleans up any artifacts remaining from previous test runs that may have
/// been interrupted before cleanup, including directories, `OpenTofu` infrastructure,
/// and LXD resources. This ensures a clean slate for new test execution.
///
/// # Arguments
///
/// * `env` - The test environment containing configuration and services
///
/// # Returns
///
/// Returns `Ok(())` if cleanup succeeds or if there were no resources to clean up.
///
/// # Errors
///
/// Returns an error if cleanup fails and would prevent new test runs.
