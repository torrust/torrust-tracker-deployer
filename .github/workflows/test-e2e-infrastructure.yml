name: E2E Infrastructure Lifecycle Tests

# This workflow tests infrastructure provisioning and destruction (creating and destroying VMs/containers)
# It does NOT test software configuration/installation to avoid GitHub Actions
# network connectivity issues with LXD VMs.
#
# NOTE: This workflow uses CI-specific approaches like 'sudo chmod 666' on the LXD socket
# and 'sudo' with LXD commands. These approaches are NOT recommended for local development.
# For local use, follow the proper group membership approach documented in templates/tofu/lxd/README.md
#
# NETWORK TUNING: We use smorimoto/tune-github-hosted-runner-network to fix flaky networking
# issues that cause Docker GPG key downloads to fail intermittently in GitHub Actions.
# See: https://github.com/actions/runner-images/issues/1187 and https://github.com/actions/runner-images/issues/2890
