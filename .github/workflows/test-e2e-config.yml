name: E2E Configuration Tests

# This workflow tests ONLY software configuration, release, and run phases
# using Docker containers. It does NOT test infrastructure provisioning
# (VMs/containers creation) as that is handled by the E2E Provision Tests
# workflow.
#
# This workflow uses Docker containers instead of LXD VMs to avoid GitHub
# Actions network connectivity issues within VMs that prevent software
# installation.
#
# NETWORK TUNING: We use smorimoto/tune-github-hosted-runner-network to fix
# flaky networking issues that cause Docker GPG key downloads to fail
# intermittently in GitHub Actions.
# See: https://github.com/actions/runner-images/issues/1187 and
# https://github.com/actions/runner-images/issues/2890
