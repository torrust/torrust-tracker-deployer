name: SDK Examples Tests

# This workflow runs SDK examples that are compatible with GitHub-hosted runners.
#
# RUNNER LIMITATION: LXD VMs created on GitHub runners have no internal network
# connectivity. As a result, any example that requires communication with a
# running VM is excluded. The affected commands are: configure, release, run, test.
#
# COMPATIBLE EXAMPLES (can run in CI):
#   - sdk_basic_usage  — local-only operations (create, list, show, exists,
#                        validate, destroy, purge). No infrastructure required.
#
# INCOMPATIBLE EXAMPLES (local only, not run here):
#   - sdk_full_deployment — uses configure, release, run, and test which require
#                           VM network connectivity unavailable on GitHub runners.
#
# When new examples that only use compatible operations are added, register them
# in the "Run SDK examples" step below.
